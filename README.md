# USPTO OPD Bulk File Loader

Welcome to the USPTO OPD Bulk File Loader project! This repository is part of a series of open-source initiatives launched from [patent.dev](patent.dev/projects). My goal is to create a tool that simplifies the downloading of bulk patent data files from the new USPTO Open Data Portal (OPD), making it easier for developers, patent researchers, and analysts to access and work with USPTO data.

## Project purpose

The USPTO’s Open Data Portal (OPD) has recently consolidated data and functionality previously available on PEDS and BDSS, which are soon to be retired. This project aims to create a reliable bulk file downloader to facilitate easy retrieval of patent data from the OPD, helping users streamline data access without the need for manual downloads.

## Why is this repository empty?

To gauge community interest, I’m using GitHub stars and forks as indicators of demand:

- 100 Stars – If this repository reaches 100 stars, it will signal enough interest to justify starting the project.
- 10 Forks – When at least 10 users fork this repository, it shows there’s a group interested in contributing.

Once these thresholds are met, I’ll begin implementing the downloader and updating the repository with our progress.

## How you can help

If this project sounds valuable to you, here’s how you can show your support:

- Star the Repository – Show your interest in seeing this project come to life.
- Fork the Repository – If you’re interested in contributing, please fork it! This will signal a readiness within the community to build this tool together.

Thank you for considering this project! With enough support, we can create a valuable resource for the patent community. For more project ideas, visit patent.dev.
